NOTES
================================================================================

The warnings are informational and indicate that the user field in the inventory
should include an 'address' subfield formatted as a URI. This is a recommended
field per OCFL 1.1 specification but not required for validity.

Example of compliant user field:
{
  "name": "A Person",
  "address": "mailto:person@example.org"
}

The object successfully passes all OCFL validation checks and is ready for use.
