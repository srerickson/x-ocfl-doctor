OCFL OBJECT VALIDATION REPORT
=============================

Object Path: /workspace/objects/obj-036
Validation Date: 2025-11-09
Validation Status: INVALID

VALIDATION ERRORS
=================

1. Unimplemented or Missing Version of OCFL Specification
   - Error Code: UNIMPLEMENTED_OR_MISSING_VERSION
   - Description: The object structure does not contain a valid OCFL specification version

OBJECT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
==========================

Current Directory Contents:
- /workspace/objects/obj-036/.keep (empty placeholder file)

Issues Identified:
------------------

1. MISSING REQUIRED OCFL STRUCTURE
   - The object directory is virtually empty, containing only a .keep placeholder file
   - No valid OCFL object directory structure is present

2. MISSING CRITICAL OCFL FILES
   The following required OCFL object files are missing:

   a) ocfl_object_root.txt (REQUIRED)
      - Must be located at: /workspace/objects/obj-036/ocfl_object_root.txt
      - Purpose: Identifies the directory as an OCFL object root
      - Required Content: "ocfl_object_<version>"
      - Example: "ocfl_object_1.1" or "ocfl_object_1.0"

   b) inventory.json (REQUIRED)
      - Must be located at: /workspace/objects/obj-036/inventory.json
      - Purpose: Contains metadata and version history of the object
      - Content: Must be a valid JSON file with OCFL inventory structure

   c) inventory.json.sha512 (RECOMMENDED)
      - Must be located at: /workspace/objects/obj-036/inventory.json.sha512
      - Purpose: Checksum for inventory file integrity verification

3. MISSING VERSION DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
   - No version directories (v1, v2, etc.) are present
   - At minimum, v1 directory should exist with object content

4. NO OBJECT CONTENT
   - No actual object content files are present in any version directories

DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FIXING THE OBJECT
===============================================

Step 1: Create the ocfl_object_root.txt File
   Command: echo "ocfl_object_1.1" > /workspace/objects/obj-036/ocfl_object_root.txt

   This file marks the directory as an OCFL object root and specifies the OCFL version being used.

Step 2: Create the Inventory Structure
   The inventory.json must follow the OCFL specification format:

   {
     "id": "obj-036",
     "type": "object",
     "digestAlgorithm": "sha512",
     "head": "v1",
     "manifest": {
       "checksumValue": {
         "state": {
           "path": "v1/state/filename.ext"
         }
       }
     },
     "state": {
       "v1": {
         "path": "state/filename.ext"
       }
     }
   }

Step 3: Create Version Directories
   - Create v1 directory: mkdir -p /workspace/objects/obj-036/v1
   - Create content directory structure under v1
   - Move or copy object content files into the version directory

Step 4: Generate the Inventory Checksum
   Command: sha512sum inventory.json > inventory.json.sha512

   This creates a checksum file for integrity verification.

Step 5: Re-validate the Object
   Command: ocfl validate --object=/workspace/objects/obj-036

   Run this command after making the above changes to verify the object is now valid.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
================

- The current object structure is completely empty except for a .keep placeholder file
- This appears to be an uninitialized or improperly created OCFL object
- The object needs to be properly initialized according to the OCFL (Oxford Common File Layout) specification
- OCFL version 1.1 is recommended for new objects (OCFL spec: https://ocfl.io/spec/)

STATUS SUMMARY
==============

The OCFL object at /workspace/objects/obj-036 is INVALID and requires complete reconstruction
following the OCFL specification. The object currently lacks all mandatory OCFL structure elements
and contains no actual data.
