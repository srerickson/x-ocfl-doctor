OCFL OBJECT VALIDATION AND REPAIR LOG
================================================================================
Object Name: obj-036
Date: 2024-11-12T00:00:00Z
================================================================================

INITIAL VALIDATION RESULTS:
---------------------------
Status: INVALID

Errors Found:
1. UNIMPLEMENTED_OR_MISSING_VERSION - Object was missing OCFL specification 
   version declaration
2. MISSING_NAMASTE_DECLARATION - Missing NAMASTE file (0=ocfl_object_1.1)
3. EMPTY_DIRECTORY - Object directory only contained .keep placeholder file
4. MISSING_INVENTORY - No inventory.json files present
5. MISSING_REQUIRED_FILES - Missing all OCFL required directory structure

REPAIR ACTIONS TAKEN:
---------------------
The object was reconstructed to meet OCFL 1.1 specification requirements:

1. Created NAMASTE declaration file
   File: 0=ocfl_object_1.1
   Content: "ocfl_object_1.1"
   Purpose: Declares OCFL version and object boundaries

2. Created OCFL object directory structure
   Created: v1/ directory (first version)
   
3. Created inventory.json for version v1
   Location: v1/inventory.json
   - Object ID: urn:uuid:obj-036
   - Type: https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/#inventory
   - Digest Algorithm: SHA512
   - Head Version: v1
   - Manifest: empty (no content files)
   - Versions: Single version (v1) with empty state
   - Metadata: Created timestamp, user info

4. Created root-level inventory.json
   Location: inventory.json
   Content: Copy of v1/inventory.json
   Purpose: Points to current head version

5. Created SHA512 sidecar files
   Files: inventory.json.sha512 (root and v1/)
   Format: SHA512_HASH inventory.json
   Purpose: Integrity verification of inventory files

6. Removed invalid files
   Deleted: .keep file (not OCFL-compliant)
   
7. Created copy in repaired directory
   Location: /workspace/repaired/obj-036
   Purpose: Preserve repaired version separately

FINAL VALIDATION RESULTS:
------------------------
Status: VALID
Validation Command: ocfl validate --object /workspace/repaired/obj-036
Result: SUCCESS (exit code 0)

The object now conforms to OCFL 1.1 specification.

FINAL OBJECT STRUCTURE:
-----------------------
/workspace/repaired/obj-036/
├── 0=ocfl_object_1.1          (NAMASTE declaration)
├── inventory.json             (root-level inventory)
├── inventory.json.sha512      (root-level integrity sidecar)
└── v1/                        (version directory)
    ├── inventory.json         (version inventory)
    └── inventory.json.sha512  (version integrity sidecar)

NOTES:
------
- Object had no content files, so no content directory was created
- This is a minimal but valid OCFL object structure
- All required OCFL 1.1 specification elements are present
- Integrity checksums are valid
- Object is ready for use in OCFL repositories
