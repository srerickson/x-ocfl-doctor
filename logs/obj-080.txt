OCFL Object Validation and Repair Log
=====================================

Object: obj-080
Date: 2025-11-13
Process: Validation and Repair

VALIDATION PROCESS
------------------

Command executed:
  ocfl validate --object /workspace/objects/obj-080

Validation Result: VALID

Warnings detected (non-fatal):
1. WARN: v1/inventory.json has different 'message' in its v1 version block than the root inventory.json
   Code: W011
2. WARN: v1/inventory.json has different 'user' in its v1 version block than the root inventory.json
   Code: W011
3. WARN: v1/inventory.json has different 'created' in its v1 version block than the root inventory.json
   Code: W011

ANALYSIS
--------

The object obj-080 is VALID. The warnings indicate that the v1/inventory.json file has 
different metadata (message, user, created) in its version block compared to the root 
inventory.json. These are warnings (W011) rather than errors, meaning the object structure 
is compliant with OCFL specification but there are metadata inconsistencies.

Since the object validates as VALID (exit code 0), no repair is required.
