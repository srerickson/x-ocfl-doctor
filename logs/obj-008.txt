OCFL OBJECT VALIDATION REPORT: obj-008
======================================

VALIDATION STATUS: INVALID

VALIDATION ERROR DETAILS
------------------------
Error Code: E010
Error Message: missing version in version sequence: v2
Location: root inventory.json
Object Path: /workspace/objects/obj-008

SUMMARY OF ISSUES
-----------------
The OCFL object validation has identified a critical error in the version sequence.
The inventory.json file declares versions v1, v4, v5, v7, and v8, but is missing
versions v2, v3, and v6 in the sequence.

DETAILED ANALYSIS
-----------------
1. MISSING VERSIONS IN SEQUENCE:
   - The root inventory.json contains version definitions for: v1, v4, v5, v7, v8
   - Missing versions: v2, v3, v6
   - Expected sequence: v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8 (continuous)
   - Actual sequence: v1, v4, v5, v7, v8 (gaps at positions 2, 3, and 6)

2. OCFL SPECIFICATION VIOLATION:
   According to the OCFL specification, versions must form a continuous sequence
   starting from v1. Each subsequent version must be sequentially numbered without gaps.

   The error "missing version in version sequence: v2" indicates that the validator
   checked for v2 after finding v1, but v2 does not exist in the object structure.

3. PHYSICAL VS. LOGICAL STRUCTURE:
   - Physical directories present: v1/, v4/, v5/, v7/, v8/
   - Logical versions declared: v1, v4, v5, v7, v8 (in inventory.json)
   - The inventory.json correctly references only the existing versions, but this
     violates the OCFL requirement for continuous version numbering.

4. IMPACT:
   - This object cannot be validated as a compliant OCFL object
   - The object cannot be trusted for long-term preservation purposes
   - Potential data loss if this object is processed by OCFL-compliant tools

RECOMMENDED STEPS FOR FIXING THE OBJECT
----------------------------------------
Option 1: RESTORE MISSING VERSIONS (Preferred if possible)
   - Recover version directories v2, v3, and v6 if they exist in backups
   - Restore the missing inventory.json and inventory.json.sha512 files
   - Ensure all version directories have proper inventory files and content
   - Re-validate after restoration

Option 2: REBUILD INVENTORY WITH PLACEHOLDER VERSIONS (If recovery is impossible)
   - Create placeholder version directories v2, v3, and v6
   - Each directory should contain:
     * An inventory.json file with a valid version entry
     * An inventory.json.sha512 file with proper digest
   - The missing versions should be inserted with appropriate:
     * created timestamps (between adjacent versions)
     * state entries (can be identical to previous version or empty)
     * message and user information
   - After rebuilding, re-validate the object

Option 3: CONTACT PRESERVATION TEAM
   - If this object is critical, contact your OCFL preservation team
   - Investigate how versions v2, v3, and v6 were deleted or lost
   - Determine if there's a systematic issue affecting other objects
   - Review backup/archival procedures to prevent future occurrences

VERIFICATION STEPS
------------------
After fixing the object, run the validation command to confirm:
   ocfl validate --object=/workspace/objects/obj-008

Expected output on success: (no errors reported)

ADDITIONAL NOTES
----------------
- The object has a valid OCFL declaration file (0=ocfl_object_1.1)
- All existing version directories (v1, v4, v5, v7, v8) have inventory files
- The root inventory.json is well-formed JSON
- The error is specifically about missing versions in the sequence, not file corruption
