OCFL OBJECT VALIDATION REPORT
Object ID: obj-026
Validation Date: 2025-11-09
Status: INVALID

================================================================================
VALIDATION ERRORS SUMMARY
================================================================================

The OCFL object at /workspace/objects/obj-026 failed validation with the following error:
- "unimplemented or missing version of the OCFL specification"

Critical Issue: Object lacks the OCFL version declaration file


================================================================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS
================================================================================

1. MISSING OCFL DECLARATION FILE
   - Issue: The object directory does not contain the required OCFL version
     declaration file in the format "0=ocfl_object_X.X"
   - Expected Files:
     * 0=ocfl_object_1.0 (for OCFL 1.0)
     * 0=ocfl_object_1.1 (for OCFL 1.1, recommended)
   - Current Structure:
     * /workspace/objects/obj-026/settings.local.json (found)
     * No OCFL version declaration file (NOT found)
   - Impact: The OCFL validator cannot determine which version of the OCFL
     specification this object should conform to, making validation impossible.

2. OBJECT DIRECTORY CONTENTS
   Current content of /workspace/objects/obj-026/:
   - settings.local.json: A configuration file with permissions settings
     (133 bytes)

   This appears to be incomplete and does not conform to OCFL structure
   requirements. A valid OCFL object should contain:
   - Version declaration file (0=ocfl_object_X.X)
   - inventory.json or inventory.json.sha512 (inventory manifest)
   - Versioned directories (v0, v1, etc.)
   - Optional root inventory (for version 1.1)

3. COMPARISON WITH VALID OCFL OBJECTS
   Other objects in the storage root (obj-003, obj-004, obj-032, etc.)
   contain the proper declaration file:
   - Pattern: 0=ocfl_object_1.1
   This is the OCFL 1.1 specification version marker and is mandatory.


================================================================================
ROOT CAUSES
================================================================================

1. Missing OCFL Version Declaration
   - The object lacks the version declaration file required by OCFL specification
   - Without this file, the validator cannot proceed

2. Incomplete Object Structure
   - The object only contains settings.local.json
   - Missing: inventory.json, version directories (v0, etc.)
   - This suggests the object is either corrupted or incomplete


================================================================================
RECOMMENDED REMEDIATION STEPS
================================================================================

Option 1: Add OCFL Version Declaration (Minimum Fix)
   1. Create the OCFL version declaration file:
      Command: touch /workspace/objects/obj-026/0=ocfl_object_1.1
      (or 0=ocfl_object_1.0 if using OCFL 1.0)
   2. Validate again to check for additional structural issues
   3. The validator will then reveal other missing components

Option 2: Complete Object Restoration (Recommended)
   1. Check if a backup or alternate version of obj-026 exists
   2. Restore the complete object structure including:
      - 0=ocfl_object_1.1 declaration file
      - inventory.json (with SHA512 checksum file)
      - v0 directory with actual content
      - v1+ directories if applicable
   3. Validate the restored object

Option 3: Recreate Object from Source
   1. Identify the original source files for this object
   2. Use the OCFL tool to create a new object with proper structure
   3. Assign it a new object ID or replace the corrupted one
   4. Validate the newly created object

Option 4: Investigate and Document Corruption
   1. Review logs or records for how obj-026 was created
   2. Determine when corruption occurred
   3. Check if other objects show similar patterns
   4. Implement preventive measures


================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- The settings.local.json file found in the object appears to be a permissions
  configuration file and is not part of the OCFL specification.
- It's unclear how this file got into the object directory, as it may indicate
  a migration or tool-specific issue.
- All other objects in the storage root properly declare OCFL 1.1 as their
  specification version.
- This object requires intervention before it can be validated or accessed.
