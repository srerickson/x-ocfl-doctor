OCFL Object Validation and Repair Log
======================================

Object Name: obj-075
Validation Date: 2025-11-13
Status: VALID

VALIDATION PROCESS
-------------------

Initial Validation Command:
  ocfl validate --object /workspace/objects/obj-075

Validation Exit Code: 0 (Success)

VALIDATION RESULTS
------------------

The object validation completed successfully. The following warnings were detected but do not constitute errors:

WARNINGS IDENTIFIED:

1. W005 - Object ID is not a URI (Non-Critical)
   - Issue: Object ID "bb123cd4567" is not formatted as a URI
   - Locations: root inventory.json and all version inventory.json files (v0001, v0002, v0003, v0004)
   - Impact: Warning only - object is still valid
   - Recommendation: For stricter OCFL compliance, consider using URI format (e.g., "http://example.org/obj-075" or "urn:uuid:...")

2. W004 - digestAlgorithm is "sha256" (Non-Critical)
   - Issue: digestAlgorithm is set to "sha256" (lowercase)
   - Locations: All inventory.json files (root, v0001, v0002, v0003, v0004)
   - Impact: Warning only - sha256 is a valid algorithm
   - Recommendation: For strict RFC compliance, consider updating to "sha512" or other standard algorithms

3. W001 - Version directory names are zero-padded (Non-Critical)
   - Issue: Version directories use zero-padded naming (v0001, v0002, etc.)
   - Impact: Warning only - this is valid OCFL format
   - Recommendation: This is actually a best practice for OCFL implementations

CONCLUSION
-----------

The OCFL object obj-075 has successfully passed validation.
