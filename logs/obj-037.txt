OCFL OBJECT VALIDATION REPORT
================================================================================
Object ID: http://example.org/E058_no_sidecar
Object Path: /workspace/objects/obj-037
Validation Status: INVALID
Validation Errors: 2

VALIDATION ERRORS
================================================================================

1. ERROR CODE E060 - Missing Inventory Sidecar File
   Message: ERRO open inventory.json.sha512: no such file or directory
   Location: /workspace/objects/obj-037/
   Description: The root-level inventory.json.sha512 sidecar file is missing.

2. ERROR CODE E058 - Missing Root Inventory Sidecar
   Message: ERRO root contents: root inventory.json sidecar: file does not exist
   Location: /workspace/objects/obj-037/
   Description: The OCFL specification requires a SHA512 sidecar file for the
   root inventory.json file to ensure integrity validation.

ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Current Object Structure:
  /workspace/objects/obj-037/
  ├── 0=ocfl_object_1.1          (OCFL version declaration - Present)
  ├── inventory.json             (Root inventory - Present)
  ├── inventory.json.sha512      (Root inventory sidecar - MISSING)
  └── v1/
      ├── content/
      │   └── file.txt
      ├── inventory.json         (Version inventory - Present)
      └── inventory.json.sha512  (Version sidecar - Present)

Root Cause:
The OCFL specification (version 1.1) mandates that every inventory.json file,
including the root-level inventory at the object root, must have an accompanying
sidecar file containing its digest. The root-level inventory.json has no
inventory.json.sha512 sidecar, which is required for validation.

Note: The version v1 has the required sidecar file (inventory.json.sha512),
but the root level inventory is missing its sidecar.

RECOMMENDED STEPS FOR FIXING
================================================================================

Step 1: Calculate the SHA512 digest of the root inventory.json
   Command: sha512sum /workspace/objects/obj-037/inventory.json

Step 2: Create the sidecar file with the digest
   The sidecar file should:
   - Be named: inventory.json.sha512
   - Be located in: /workspace/objects/obj-037/
   - Contain the digest in format: "<digest> inventory.json"
   - Match the SHA512 algorithm specified in the inventory.json

Step 3: Example creation (after obtaining the hash):
   echo "<calculated_hash> inventory.json" > /workspace/objects/obj-037/inventory.json.sha512

Step 4: Re-validate the object
   Command: ocfl validate --object=/workspace/objects/obj-037

IMPACT
================================================================================
- The object cannot pass OCFL validation
- The integrity of the root inventory cannot be verified
- The object does not conform to OCFL 1.1 specification
- Operations dependent on valid OCFL objects may fail

SEVERITY: HIGH
This is a compliance issue that prevents the object from being recognized as
a valid OCFL object.
