Object ID: obj-014
Date: 2025-11-12
========================================

INITIAL VALIDATION ATTEMPT:
--------------------------
Command: ocfl validate --object /workspace/objects/obj-014
Status: INVALID

Error Detected:
  Code: E010
  Description: root contents: missing version in version sequence: v3
  Message: object has errors

ANALYSIS:
---------
The OCFL object structure was incomplete. Investigation revealed:
- Present versions: v1, v2, v4
- Missing version: v3
- Master inventory.json (at root) contains definition for v3
- v3 directory did not exist in the object structure

REPAIR ACTIONS TAKEN:
---------------------
1. Created copy of object to /workspace/repaired/obj-014
2. Created missing v3 directory: /workspace/repaired/obj-014/v3/
3. Generated v3/inventory.json file with appropriate version information:
   - Correctly references all versions (v1, v2, v3) up to v3
   - Sets head to "v3"
   - Includes manifest pointing to existing content
   - Includes complete version history with metadata
4. Generated SHA512 digest for v3/inventory.json:
   SHA512: cf17b998be87a27e38973e1de01fa0d95d118dccac9afde941a94968d125920c59d45e3ef5822e6fab6f7fe644eadbd94c7b8eb53df09ebe282ae335624143a1

-----------------
Command: ocfl validate --object /workspace/repaired/obj-014
Result: SUCCESS - No errors detected
