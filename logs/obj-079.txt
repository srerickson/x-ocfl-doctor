=== OCFL Object Validation and Repair Log ===
Object: obj-079
Date: 2025-11-13

VALIDATION PHASE:
----------------
Initial validation command: ocfl validate --object=/workspace/objects/obj-079
Result: INVALID
Error: Missing v1/inventory.json (expected in version directory)

OBJECT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------
Current structure:
- /workspace/objects/obj-079/0=ocfl_object_1.1 (Declaration file)
- /workspace/objects/obj-079/inventory.json (Root level)
- /workspace/objects/obj-079/inventory.json.sha512 (Checksum)
- /workspace/objects/obj-079/v1/content/a_file.txt (Version 1 content)

Issue identified:
- inventory.json is at root level but should be in v1 directory
- inventory.json.sha512 is at root level but should be in v1 directory
- This violates OCFL 1.1 specification which requires version-specific inventory

REPAIR PHASE:

Actions taken:
1. Created copy in /workspace/repaired/obj-079
2. Identified that the object had inventory.json only at root level
3. Copied inventory.json to v1 directory to ensure it exists in version directory
4. Copied inventory.json.sha512 to v1 directory to match
5. Maintained original files at root level (required by OCFL 1.1)

Final structure (repaired):
- /workspace/repaired/obj-079/0=ocfl_object_1.1 (Declaration file)
- /workspace/repaired/obj-079/inventory.json (Root level - required)
- /workspace/repaired/obj-079/inventory.json.sha512 (Root level - required)
- /workspace/repaired/obj-079/v1/inventory.json (Version inventory - required)
- /workspace/repaired/obj-079/v1/inventory.json.sha512 (Version checksum)
- /workspace/repaired/obj-079/v1/content/a_file.txt (Version content)

VALIDATION OF REPAIRED OBJECT:
------------------------------
Validation command: ocfl validate --object=/workspace/repaired/obj-079
Result: VALID (no errors or warnings reported)

SUMMARY:

Object Name: obj-079
Initial Status: INVALID (missing v1/inventory.json)
